## Installation on your own computer
Having made your own copy of the project at Github (previous step) you can clone your repository to your own computer. 

To build this project, you will need to use Node Package Manager (npm) to manage and install project dependencies. All npm settings, as well as your project dependencies and their versionings, are defined in the file `package.json`. We will unpack this file in the next section.

Node Package Manager, which is the world's largest software registry and supports over one million open source JavaScript packages and libraries, runs in a NodeJS runtime. The NodeJS runtime is essentially a port of Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 engine that will run directly in your terminal (instead of within a browser).

Before you begin, you will need to install [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Then, open a new terminal instance, set your working directory to the root of the project, and run `npm install`.

**Note on node versions:** The current version of this scaffolding code is known to work with older versions of node such including `v14.17.0` and `v16.20.2`, but may be broken with newer versions (like 18.3.0 and beyond). Therefore recommend starting from one of the known stable versions. It is easy to switch among different versions of node on your computer by installing [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

This skeleton project was adapted from edwinwebb's ThreeJS [seed project](https://github.com/edwinwebb/three-seed) by Reilly Bova (Princeton â€™20), and published [here on github](https://github.com/ReillyBova/three-seed). It was later slightly updated and setup as a github template by Adam Finkelstein and Joseph Lou, and is hosted [here on github](https://github.com/adamfinkelstein/cos426finalproject).
